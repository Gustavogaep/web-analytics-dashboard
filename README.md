web-analytics-dashboard
=======================

This is a simple Web Analytics Dashboard created with R and Shiny package. Visualizations are interactive and make use of Google Charts. 

The App is composed by twi files:
- server.R 
- ui.R

Data have been downloaded from Google Analytics, though you can also set up an API connection via RGoogleAnalytics package in R.

You can also check out an explanatory post how I made this app at this link: http://www.analyticsforfun.com/2015/01/google-analytics-dashboards-with-r-shiny.html
